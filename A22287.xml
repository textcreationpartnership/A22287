            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And now for that, by Gods ſacred fauour, there is likely to enſure great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his glory, Our Crown, and State, by reaſon of Our grant heeretofore made to the Counſell for the managing of the affaires of <hi>New England</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> being in breadth from forty degrees of Northerly lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from the Equinoctiall line, to forty eight degrees of the ſayd Northerly latitude, and in length by all the breadth aforeſayd, thorowout the maine land from Sea to Sea; We cannot but continue Our ſpeticall reſpect and fauour vnto them in their endeuours, and exerciſe Our Royall authority againſt the hinderers thereof. Wherefore, hauing receined certaine information of many and intolerable abuſed offered by ſundry interlopers, irregular and diſobedient perſons, that ſeeking principally their preſent and priuate profits, haue not only impeached ſome of the Planters there, of their lawfull poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, but alſo taken from them their Limber without giuing any ſatiſfaction, as in iuſtice they ought to haue done: and not there with contented, haue rined whole woods to the vtter ruine of the ſame for euer after; as alſo, by caſting of their ballaſt in the harbors of ſome of their Ilands, haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt made them vnſeruiceable: And yet not ſo contented, by their promiſcuous trading, aſwell Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners as Maſters with the Sauages, haue ouerthrowne the trade and commerce that before was had, to the great profit of the Planters, and which were in deed their principall hopes for the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that plantation, next vnto the commodities that coaſt affords of Fiſhing: Neither heerwith ſatiſfied, but as if they reſolued to omit nothing that might be impious and intolerable, they did not forbeare to barter a way to the Sauages, Swords, Pikes, Our kets, Fowling peeces, Match, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Shot, and other warlike weapons, and teach them the vſe thereof, not only to their owne preſent puniſhment (diuers of them being ſhortly after ſlain by the ſame Sauages, whom they had ſo taught, and with the ſame weapons which they had furniſhed them withall) but alſo to the hazard of the liues of Our good ſubiects already planted there, and (aſmuch as in them lay) to the making of the whole attempt it ſelfe (how pious and hopefull ſoeuer) fruſtrate, or ſo much the more difficult. We, for reformation and preuention of theſe or the like euils heereafter, and for the more cleare decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Our Kingly reſolution and iuſt intents, both to maintayne Our Royall grant already made, and to vphold and encourage by all wayes and meanes the worthy diſpoſitions of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of thoſe deſignes, haue thought fit, and doe heerby ſtraitly charge and command, That none of Our Subiects whatſoeuer, (not Aduenturers, Inhabitors or Planters in <hi>New England</hi>) preſume from hencefoorth to frequent thoſe Coaſts, to trade or traffique with thoſe people, or to intermedle in the woodes or freehold of any the Planters or Inhabitants (otherwiſe then by the licence of the ſayd Counſell, or according to the orders eſtabliſhed by Our Priuy Counſell for the releefe or eaſe of the tranſportation of the Colony in <hi>Virginia</hi>) vpon paine of Our high indignation, and the confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, penalties and for feitures in Our ſayd Royall grant expreſſed: Leauing it neuertheleſſe, in the meane time, to the diſcretion of the ſayd Counſel for <hi>New England,</hi> to proceed againſt the foreſayd offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders according to the ſame, eſpecially, ſeeing We finde the armes of the ſayd Counſell to bee open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue into that plantation any of Our louing Subiects, who are willing to ioyne with them in the charge, and participate in the profits thereof.</p>
